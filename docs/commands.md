# Commands List

To use these commands, open a terminal window in your Webdev Toolkit directory.

## Watch for changes & automatically reload pages

`grunt serve`

Opens the page in your default browser and utilizes [BrowserSync](http://browsersync.io/) to automatically reload page in browser when changes are detected. Press `Ctrl + C` to stop the command.

## Clean up CSS code, and compile SASS

`grunt` or `grunt build`

Cleans up the CSS code, its formatting and adds the appropriate vendor prefixes when necessary. This also compiles any SASS you have for now. (It'll be a separate command soon.)
