# Installation

To run this toolkit, you will need the following dependencies:

1. [Node.js](http://nodejs.org)
2. [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com)

## Installation guide

First, head over to the [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) website and install Node.js. (<b>Note</b>: After installation, you may need to update your PATH variable to include npm. This step is dependent on your operating system.)

Next, open up an elevated terminal window and execute `npm install --global gulp`.

Last step! `cd` to the Webdev Toolkit directory from your terminal window, and run `npm install` to install Webdev Toolkit's remaining dependencies.

You're done! If you have an existing website in development, you can move it into the `app` directory of Webdev Toolkit. Otherwise you can use the included files to experiment with the program.
